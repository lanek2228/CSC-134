"M5LAB" by Khris

The prison cell is a room "There is a bed and a open door North of you" 
The corridor is north of the prison cell "Walked into a dark damp hallway, smells strong of musky air. there is a dead body in front of you. you see you can head East or West"
The armory is West of the corridor "There is a room filled with old weapons and armor. Not really useful or have time to search for anything."
The Guard's station is East of the corridor "There would be a desk on your right when you enter the room. there would be a few empty desks and chairs laid around the area. There are no guards, which is a good thing"
